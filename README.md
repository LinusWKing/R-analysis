# Adolescent Mental Health Analysis with R: Understanding Depression and Anxiety

This GitHub repository houses the R script used for an in-depth analysis of adolescent mental health, focusing on the prevalence of depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in relation to various demographic attributes. Our script employs exploratory data analysis techniques, including data visualization and statistical tests, to uncover patterns and trends within the dataset. The findings are contextualized within the broader landscape of adolescent mental health research. This repository serves as a resource for those interested in understanding the complexities of adolescent mental health and provides a valuable foundation for further research and interventions in this critical field.
